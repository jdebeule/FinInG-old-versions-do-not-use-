This is the chapter of the documentation describing the polarities of projective
spaces.

<Chapter Label="polaritiesofps">
<Heading>Polarities of Projective Spaces</Heading>

A <E>polarity</E> of a incidence structure is
an incidence reversing, bijective, and involutory map on the elements of the
incidence structure. It is well known that every polarity of a projective space
is just an involutory correlation of the projective space. The construction of
correlations of a projective space is described in Chapter <Ref Chap="projgroup"/>.

In this chapter we describe methods and operations dealing with the construction
and use of polarities of projective spaces in <Package>FinInG</Package>. 

<Section>
<Heading>Creating polarities of projective spaces</Heading>

Since polarities of a projective space necessarily have an involutory field
automorphism as companion automorphism and the standard duality of the projective
space as the companion projective space isomorphism, a polarity of a projective
space is determined completely by a suitable matrix <M>A</M>. Every polarity of
a projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M> is listed in the following table, including
the conditions on the matrix <M>A</M>.

A hermitian polarity of the projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M> exists if and only
if the field <M>GF(q)</M> admits an involutory field automorphism <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\theta</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#952;</Alt>.<P/>
It is well known that there is a correspondence between polarities of projective
spaces and non-degenerate sesquilinear forms on the underlying vector space.
Consider a sesquilinear form <M>f</M> on the vector space <M>V(n+1,q)</M>. Then
<M>f</M> induces a map on the elements of <M>PG(n,q)</M> as follows: every
element with underlying subspace <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\alpha</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#945;</Alt> is mapped to the
element with underlying subspace <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\alpha^\perp</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#945;&lt;sup>&#8869;&lt;/sup></Alt>, i.e. the subspace of
<M>V(n+1,q)</M> orthogonal to <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\alpha</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#945;</Alt> with respect to the form <M>f</M>. It is clear that
this induced map is a polarity of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. Also the converse is true,
with any polarity of <M>PG(n,q)</M> corresponds a sesquilinear form on
<M>V(n+1,q)</M>. The above classification of polarities of <M>PG(n,q)</M> follows
from the classification of sesquilinear forms on <M>V(n+1,q)</M>. For more
information, we refer to <Cite Key="HirschfeldThas"/> and <Cite
Key="KleidmanLiebeck"/>. We mention that the implementation of the action of
correlations on projective points (see <Ref Sect="projgroup_actions"/>)
guarantees that a sesquilinear form with matrix <M>M</M> and field automorphism <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\theta</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#952;</Alt> corresponds to a
polarity with matrix <M>M</M> and field automorphism <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\theta</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#952;</Alt> and vice versa.<P/>

In <Package>FinInG</Package>, polarities of projective spaces are always
objects in the category <C>IsPolarityOfProjectiveSpace</C>, which is a
subcategory of the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C>. 

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="PolarityOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="mat, f"/>
<Returns>a polarity of a projective space</Returns>
<Description>The underlying correlation of
the projective space is constructed using matrix <A>mat</A>, field <A>f</A>, the identity
mapping as field automorphism and the standard duality of the projective space.
It is checked whether the matrix <A>mat</A> satisfies the necessary conditions to
induce a polarity.

<Oper Name="PolarityOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="mat, frob, f"/>
<Oper Name="HermitianPolarityOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="mat, f"/>
<Returns>a polarity of a projective space</Returns>
<Description>The underlying correlation of
the projective space is constructed using matrix <A>mat</A>, field automorphism <A>frob</A>, <A>f</A> and the standard duality of the projective space. It is
checked whether the <A>mat</A> satisfies the necessary conditions to 
induce a polarity, and whether <A>frob</A> is a non-trivial involutory field
automorphism. The second operation only needs the arguments <A>mat</A> and
<A>f</A> to construct a hermitian polarity of a projective space, provided the
field <A>f</A> allows an involutory field automorphism and <A>mat</A> satisfies
the necessary conditions. The latter is checked by constructing the underlying
hermitian form.

<Description>The polarity of the projective space is constructed using the

the polar space <A>ps</A>. When <A>ps</A> is a parabolic
quadric in even characteristic, no polarity of the ambient
projective space can be associated to <A>ps</A>, and an

<Heading>Polarities, absolute points, totally isotropic elements and finite classical polar
spaces</Heading>

We already mentioned the equivalence between polarities of <M>PG(n,q)</M> and
sesquilinear forms on <M>V(n+1,q)</M>, hence there is a relation between
polarities of <M>PG(n,q)</M> and polar spaces induced by sesquilinear forms. The
following concepts express these relations geometrically.<P/>
Suppose that <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt> is a
polarity of <M>PG(n,q)</M> and that <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\alpha</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#945;</Alt> is an element of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. We call <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\alpha</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#945;</Alt> a <E>totally
isotropic element</E> or an <E>absolute element</E> if and only if <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\alpha</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#945;</Alt> is incident with
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\alpha^\phi</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#945;&lt;sup>&#966;&lt;/sup></Alt>. An absolute element that is a
point is also called an <E>absolute point</E> or an <E>isotropic point</E>. It
is clear that an element of <M>PG(n,q)</M> is absolute if and only if the
underlying vector space is totally isotropic with respect to the sesquilinear
form equivalent to <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt>. Hence the absolute elements induce a <E>finite classical polar space</E>, the
same that is induced by the equivalent sesquilinear form. When <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt> is a pseudo-polarity,
the set of absolute elements are the elements of a hyperplane of <M>PG(n,q)</M>.

We restrict our introduction to finite classical polar spaces in this section to the following examples.
Many aspects of these geometries are extensively described in Chapter <Ref Chap="classicalpolarspaces"/>.

<Section>
<Heading>Commuting polarities</Heading>

<Package>FinInG</Package> constructs polarities of projective spaces as correlations. This allows polarities to be multiplied
easily, resulting in a collineation. The resulting collineation is constructed in the correlation group
but can be mapped onto its unique representative in the collineation group. We provide an example with two commuting polarities.
