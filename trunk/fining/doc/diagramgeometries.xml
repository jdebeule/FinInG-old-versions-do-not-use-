<Heading>Coset Geometries and Diagrams</Heading>

This part of <Package>FinInG</Package> depends
on <Package>GRAPE</Package>. 

<Section>
<Heading>Coset Geometries</Heading>

Suppose we have an <E>incidence
geometry</E> <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;</Alt>
(as defined in chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/>), together with
a group <M>G</M> of automorphisms of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;</Alt> is also given such that <M>G</M> is
transitive on the set of <E>chambers</E> of <M>\Gamma</M> (also
defined in chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/>). This implies
that <M>G</M> is also transitive on the set of all elements of any
chosen type <M>i</M>. If we consider a chamber <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{1},c_{2},... ,c_{n}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">c&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,c&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,c&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub></Alt>
such that <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> is of type <M>i</M>, 
we can look at the stabilizer <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt>
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> in <M>G</M>. The
subgroups  <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> are 
called <E>parabolic subgroups</E> of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;</Alt>. For a
type <M>i</M>, transitivity of <M>G</M> on the elements of
type <M>i</M> gives a correspondence between the cosets of the
stabilizer <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> and the elements of type <M>i</M>
in <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;</Alt>. Two elements of 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;</Alt> are incident if and only
if the corresponding cosets have a nonempty intersection.

We now use the above oservation to define an incidence structure from
a group <M>G</M> together with a set of
subgroups <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{1},G_{2},...,G_{n}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">G&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,G&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,G&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub></Alt>.
The type set is <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\{1,2,...,n\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#123;1,2,...,n&#125;</Alt>. 
By definition the elements of type <M>i</M> are the (right) cosets of the subgroup 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt>. Two
cosets are incident if and only if their intersection is not
empty. This is an incidence structure which is not necessarily a
geometry (see Chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/> for definitions).

<Heading>Diagrams</Heading>

The <E>diagram</E> of a flag-transitive incidence geometry is a
schematic description of the structure of the geometry. It is based on
the collection of rank 2 residues of the geometry.

Since the geometry is flag-transitive, all chambers are
equivalent. Let's fix a chamber <Alt Not="HTML"><M>C=\{c_{1}, c_{2},\ldots,c_{n}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">C = &#123; c&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,c&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,c&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>&#125;</Alt>,
with <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> of type <M>i</M>. For each subset 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>{i,j}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#123;i,j&#125;</Alt> of
size two in <Alt Not="HTML"><M>I={1,2,\ldots,n}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#123;1,2,...n&#125;</Alt> we take the residue of the
flag <Alt Not="HTML"><M>C\setminus \{c_{i},c_{j}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">C \ &#123; c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub>, c&lt;sub>j&lt;/sub>&#125;</Alt>. Flag transitivity ensures
that <E>all</E> residues of type <M>I\setminus\{i,j\}</M> are
isomorphic to each other. For each such residue, the structure is
described by some parameters: the gonality and the point and line
diameters. For each type <M>i</M>, we also define the <M>i</M>-order
to be the elements of type <M>i</M> in the residue of a(ny) flag of
type <M>I\setminus\{i\}</M>. All this information is depicted in
a <E>diagram</E> which is bascically a graph with vertex set <M>I</M>
and edges whenever the point diamater, the line diameter and the
gonality are all greater than <M>2</M>.

<ManSection>

<Returns>the diagram of the geometry <A>Gamma</A></Returns>

<A>Gamma</A> must be a coset geometry.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="DrawDiagram" Arg="Diag,filename"/>
<Returns>does not return anything but writes a file <A>filename</A>.ps</Returns>
<Description> 
<A>Diag</A> must be a diagram. Writes a file <A>filename</A>.ps in the current directory with a pictorial version of the diagram. This command uses the <Package>graphviz</Package> package which is available from http://www.graphviz.org. 
</Description>
</ManSection>

We illustrate the diagram feature with
Neumaier's <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>-geometry. 

The affine space of dimension 3 over the field with two elements is
denoted by <M>AG(3,2)</M>. If we fix a plane <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Pi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#928;</Alt> in <M>PG(3,2)</M>, the
structure induced on the 8 points not in <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Pi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#928;</Alt> by the lines and planes
of <M>PG(3,2)</M> is isomorphic to <M>AG(3,2)</M>. Since every two points of
<M>AG(3,2)</M> define a line, the collinearity graph of <M>AG(3,2)</M> (that is the graph
whose vertices are the points of <M>AG(3,2)</M> and in which two vertices
are adjacent whenever they are collinear) is the complete graph <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>
on 8 vertices. Given two copies of the complete graph on 8 vertices,
one can label the vertices of each of them with the numbers from 1 to
8. These labelings are always equivalent when the two copies are seen as
graphs, but not if they are understood as models of the affine
space. The reason is that an affine space has parallel lines and to be
affinely equivalent, the labelings must be such that edges which were
parallel in the first labeling remain parallel in the second
labeling. In fact there are 15 affinely nonequivalent ways to label the
vertices of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. The affine space has 14 planes of 4 points and
there are 70 subsets of 4 elements in the vertex set of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. Each
time we label <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>, there are 14 of the 70 sets of 4 elements which
become planes of <M>AG(3,2)</M>. The remaining 4-subsets will be called 
<E>nonplanes</E> for that labeling.

A well-known rank 4 geometry discovered by Neumaier
in 1984 can be described using these concepts. This geometry is quite
important since its residue of cotype 0 is the famous 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_7</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>7&lt;/sub></Alt>-geometry which is known to be the only flag-transitive locally
classical <M>C_3</M>-geometry which is not a polar space (see Aschbacher1984
for details).

The Neumaier geometry can be constructed as follows. The elements of
types 1 and 2 are the vertices and edges of the complete graph <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>,
the elements of type 2 are the 4-subsets of the vertex set 
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt> and the elements of type 3 are the 15 nonequivalent labelings
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. Incidences are mostly the natural ones. A 4-subset
is incident with a labeling of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt> if it is the set of points of a
nonplane in the model of <M>AG(3,2)</M> defined by the labeling.
