<Heading>Coset Geometries and Diagrams</Heading>

This part of <Package>FinInG</Package> depends
on <Package>GRAPE</Package>. 

<Section>
<Heading>Coset Geometries</Heading>

Suppose we have a flag-transitive incidence
geometry <M>\Gamma</M>. This means that a group <M>G</M> of
automorphisms of <M>\Gamma</M> is also given such that <M>G</M> is
transitive on the set of chambers of <M>\Gamma</M>. This implies
that <M>G</M> is also transitive on the set of all elements of any
chosen type <M>i</M>. If we consider a chamber <M>c_{1},c_{2},... ,c_{n}</M>
such that <M>c_{i}</M> is of type <M>i</M>, we can look at the
stabilizer <M>G_{i}</M> of <M>c_{i}</M> in <M>G</M>. The
subgroups <M>G_{i}</M> are 
called <E>parabolic subgroups</E> of <M>\Gamma</M>. For a
type <M>i</M>, transitivity of <M>G</M> on the elements of
type <M>i</M> gives a correspondence between the cosets of the
stabilizer <M>G_{i}</M> and the elements of type <M>i</M>
in <M>\Gamma</M>. Two elements of <M>\Gamma</M> are incident if and only
if the corresponding cosets have a nonempty intersection.

We now use the above oservation to define an incidence structure from
a group <M>G</M> together with a set of
subgroups <M>G_{1},G_{2},... ,G_{n}</M>. The type set
is <M>\{1,2,...,n\}</M>. By definition the elements of
type <M>i</M> are the (right) cosets of the subgroup <M>G_{i}</M>. Two
cosets are incident if and only if their intersection is not
empty. This is an incidence structure which is not necessarily a
geometry (see Section REF!!! for definitions).

<Section>
<Heading>Diagrams</Heading>

The <E>diagram</E> of a flag-transitive incidence geometry is a
schematic description of the structure of the geometry. It is based on
the collection of rank 2 residues of the geometry.

Since the geometry is flag-transitive, all chambers are
equivalent. Let's fix a chamber <M>C=\{c_{1}, c_{2},...,c_{n}\}</M>,
with <M>c_{i}</M> of type <M>i</M>. For each subset <M>{i,j}</M> of
size two in <M>I=\{1,2,...,n\}</M> we take the residue of the
flag <M>C\setminus \{c_{i},c_{j}\}</M>. Flag transitivity ensures
that <E>all</E> residues of type <M>I\setminus\{i,j\}</M> are
isomorphic to each other. For each such residue, the structure is
described by some parameters: the gonality and the point and line
diameters. For each type <M>i</M>, we also define the <M>i</M>-order
to be the elements of type <M>i</M> in the residue of a(ny) flag of
type <M>I\setminus\{i\}</M>. All this information is depicted in
a <E>diagram</E> which is bascically a graph with vertex set <M>I</M>
and edges whenever the point diamater, the line diameter and the
gonality are all greater than <M>2</M>.
