<Heading>Geometry Morphisms</Heading>

Here we describe what is meant by a <E>geometry morphism</E>
in <Package>FinInG</Package> and the various operations and tools available
to the user.

<Section>
<Heading>Geometry morphisms in FinInG</Heading>

Suppose that <M>S</M> and <M>S'</M> are two incidence geometries. 
A <E>geometry morphism</E> from <M>S</M> to <M>S'</M> is defined to be a map
from the elements of <M>S</M> to the elements of <M>S'</M> which preserves
incidence and induces a function from the type set of <M>S</M> to the
type set of <M>S'</M>. For instance, a correlation and a collineation are
examples of geometry morphisms, but they have been dealt with in more specific
ways in <Package>FinInG</Package>.  We will mainly be concerned with geometry
morphisms where the source and range are different. Hence, the natural embedding
of a projective space in a larger projective space, the mapping induced by field
reduction, and the Klein correspondence are examples of such geometry morphisms.

<ManSection>
<Fam Name = "IsGeometryMorphism"/>
<Description>
The category <C>IsGeometryMorphism</C> represents a special object
in <Package>FinInG</Package> which carries attributes and the given element
map. The element map is given as a <C>IsGeneralMapping</C>, and so has a source
and range.
<Example>
gap> ShowImpliedFilters(IsGeometryMorphism);
Implies:
   IsGeneralMapping
   IsTotal
   Tester(IsTotal)
   IsSingleValued
   Tester(IsSingleValued)
</Example>
The usual operations of <C>ImagesElm</C>, <C>ImagesSet</C>, <C>PreImagesElm</C>, 
<C>PreImagesSet</C> work for geometry
morphisms, as well as the overload operator <C>\^</C>. Since <C>Image</C> is
a &GAP; function, we advise the user to not use this for geometry morphisms.
</Description>
</ManSection>

For some geometry morphisms, there is also an accompanying intertwiner for
the automorphism groups of the source range. Given a geometry morphism
<M>f</M> from <M>S</M> to <M>S'</M>, an intertwiner <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt> is a map
from the automorphism group of <M>S</M> to the automorphism group of 
<M>S'</M>, such that for every element <M>p</M> of <M>S</M> and every
automorphism <M>g</M> of <M>S</M>, we have
<Alt Not="HTML"><Display> f(p^g) = f(p)^{\phi(g)} .</Display></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML"><Display>f(p&lt;sup>g&lt;/sup>)=f(p)&lt;sup>&#966;(g)&lt;/sup>.</Display></Alt>

<Attr Name = "Intertwiner" Arg = "f"/>
<Returns>a group homomorphism</Returns>
<Description>
The arguments <A>f</A> is a geometry morphism. If <A>f</A> comes equipped with
a natural intertwiner from the the automorphism group of the source of <A>f</A> to
the automorphism group to the image of <A>f</A>, then the user may be able
to obtain the intertwiner by calling this operation (see the individual geometry
morphism constructions). Here is a simple example of the intertwiner for the isomorphism
of two polar spaces (see <Ref Oper="IsomorphismPolarSpaces" Style="Text"/>).

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="IsomorphismPolarSpaces" Arg="ps1, ps2"/>
<Oper Name="IsomorphismPolarSpaces" Arg="ps1, ps2, boolean"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The arguments <A>ps1</A> and <A>ps2</A> are equivalent polar spaces, and this
function returns a geometry isomorphism between them. 
The optional third argument <A>boolean</A> can take either <C>true</C> or
<C>false</C> as input, and then our operation will or will not compute the 
intertwiner accordingly. The user may wish that the intertwiner is not computed
when working with large polar spaces. The default (when calling the operation
with two arguments) is set to <C>true</C>, and in this case,
if at least one of <A>ps1</A> or <A>ps2</A> has
a collineation group installed as an attribute, then an intertwining
homomorphism is installed as an attribute. That is, we also obtain a natural
group isomorphism from the collineation group of <A>ps1</A> onto the collineation
group of <A>ps2</A> (see also <Ref Attr="Intertwiner" Style="Text"/>).

<Heading>When will you use geometry morphisms?</Heading>

When using groups in &GAP;, we often use homomorphisms to pass from
one situation to another, even though mathematically it may appear to
be unneccessary, there can be ambiguities if the functionality
is too flexible. This also applies to finite geometry. Take for example
the usual exercise of thinking of a hyperplane in a projective
space as another projective space. To conform with similar things in
&GAP;, the right thing to do is to embed one projective space into another,
rather than having one projective space automatically a substructure
of another. The reason for this is that there are many ways one can
do this embedding, even though we may dispense with this choice when we
are working mathematically. So to avoid ambiguity, we stipulate that
one should construct the embedding explicitly. How this is done will
be the subject of the following section.
</Section>


<Section>
<Heading>Natural geometry morphisms</Heading>

The most natural of geometry morphisms include, for example, the embedding of a
projective space into another via a subspace, or the projection of a polar space
to a smaller polar space of the same type via a totally isotropic subspace.


<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NaturalEmbeddingBySubspace" Arg="geom1, geom2, v"/>
<Oper Name="NaturalEmbeddingBySubspaceNC" Arg="geom1, geom2, v"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The arguments <A>geom1</A> and <A>geom2</A> are both projective spaces,
or both polar spaces, and <A>v</A> is an element of a projective or polar space.  This function
returns a geometry morphism representing the natural embedding of <A>geom1</A>
into <A>geom2</A> as the subspace <A>v</A>. Hence <A>geom1</A> and <A>v</A> must
be equivalent as geometries. The operation <C>NaturalEmbeddingBySubspaceNC</C>
is the ``no check'' version of <C>NaturalEmbeddingBySubspace</C>.

<Oper Name="NaturalEmbeddingByFieldReduction" Arg="geom1, geom2"/>
<Oper Name="NaturalEmbeddingByFieldReduction" Arg="geom1, geom2, B"/>
<Oper Name="NaturalEmbeddingByFieldReduction" Arg="geom1, geom2, boolean"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The arguments <A>geom1</A> and <A>geom2</A> are projective or polar spaces.
This function returns a geometry morphism representing the natural embedding
of <A>geom1</A> into <A>geom2</A> via field reduction. By <E>natural</E> for projective spaces,
we mean that the embedding is induced by considering the field <M>F_1</M>
of <A>geom1</A> as a vector space over the field <M>F_2</M> of <A>geom2</A>, perhaps with
a choice of basis <A>B</A> in the case we have projective spaces.
If <A>geom1</A> and <A>geom2</A> are polar spaces, then the only such possible embeddings are
listed in the table below (see <Cite Key="Gill"/>):

</Table>

The geometry morphism also comes equipped with an intertwiner (see 
<Ref Attr="Intertwiner" Style="Text"/>). In the case polar spaces,
this intertwiner has as its domain the isometry group of <A>geom1</A>.
The optional third argument <A>boolean</A> can take either <C>true</C> or
<C>false</C> as input, and then our operation will or will not compute the 
intertwiner accordingly. The user may wish that the intertwiner is not computed
when embedding into large polar spaces. The default (when calling the operation
with two arguments) is set to <C>true</C>.
Here is a simple example where the geometry morphism takes the points
of <M>PG(2,9)</M> and maps them to the lines of <M>PG(5,3)</M>.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/morphisms_fieldreduc1.include"> 
</Example>

Suppose we have field reduction from a polar space <M>P_1</M> to a polar space <M>P_2</M>, and suppose
that they are both defined by sesquilinear forms. Let <M>M</M> be the Gram matrix for the sesquilinear form
defining <M>P_1</M> and let <M>\{b_1,..,b_m\}</M> be a basis for the larger defining field of <M>F</M> <M>P_1</M> over
the smaller defining field <M>K</M> of <M>P_2</M>. Now the <C>BlownUpMat</C> command takes as input a matrix <A>mat</A>
over <M>F</M> and returns the matrix of the linear transformation on the row space <M>K^{mn}</M> with respect to
the <M>K</M>-basis whose vectors are <M>\{b_1 v_1, ... b_m v_1, ..., b_mv_n\}</M>, where
<M>\{v_1,...,v_n\}</M> is a basis for <M>F^n</M>. Hence if we have a singular vector <M>x=(x_1,...,x_n)</M>
of <M>P_1</M>, then the blow-up of <M>x</M> will be singular if and only if
for all <M>i,j \in \{1,...,m\}</M>, we have
<Display>\sum_{k=1}^n Coeff(x_kb_i)\cdot Coeff(M_k\cdot x b_j)=0</Display>
where <M>Coeff</M> is the map which takes the coefficients of an element of <M>F</M> with respect to
<M>\{b_1,..,b_m\}</M>, and <M>M_k</M> is the k-th row of <M>M</M>.

<Par></Par>
In this example, we consider the image of the Hermitian variety <M>H(2,25)</M> in <M>Q^-(5,5)</M>.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NaturalProjectionBySubspace" Arg="ps, v"/>
<Oper Name="NaturalProjectionBySubspaceNC" Arg="ps, v"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>ps</A> is a projective or polar space, and <A>v</A> is a
subspace of <A>ps</A>. In the case that <A>ps</A> is a projective space, this
operation returns a geometry morphism from the subspaces containing
<A>v</A> to the subspaces of a smaller projective space over the same
field. Similarly, if <A>ps</A> is a polar space, this operation returns a
geometry morphism from the totally singular subspaces containing <A>v</A> to a
polar space of smaller dimension, but of the same polar space type.
The operation <C>NaturalProjectionBySubspaceNC</C> performs in exactly
the same way as <C>NaturalProjectionBySubspace</C> except that there
are fewer checks such as whether <A>v</A> is a subspace of <A>ps</A>,
and whether the input of the function and preimage of the returned
geometry morphism is valid or not. We should also mention here a shorthand for
this operation which is basically and overload of the quotient operation. So,
for example, <C>SymplecticSpace(3, 3) / v</C> achieves the same thing
as <C>NaturalProjectionBySubspace(SymplecticSpace(3,3), v)</C>.

<Heading>Some special kinds of geometry morphisms</Heading>

In this section we provide some more specialised geometry morphisms,
that are commonly used in finite geometry.

		   
<ManSection>
<Oper Name="KleinCorrespondence" Arg="quadric"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>quadric</A> is a 5-dimensional hyperbolic quadric
<M>Q^+(5,q)</M>, and this function returns the Klein correspondence from the lines
of <M>PG(3,q)</M> to the points of <A>quadric</A>.
<Example>

</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NaturalDuality" Arg="gq"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>gq</A> is either the symplectic generalised quadrangle
<C>W(3,q)</C> or the hermitian generalised quadrangle <C>H(3,q^2)</C>.  By the
Klein correspondence, the lines of <M>W(3,q)</M> are mapped to the points
of <M>Q(4,q)</M>, which results in a point-line duality from <M>W(3,q)</M>
onto <M>Q(4,q)</M>. Likewise, the Klein correspondence induces a duality
between <M>H(3,q^2)</M> and <M>Q^-(5,q)</M>.  At the moment, the geometry
morphism returned is a map from lines to points.  This operation does not
require that the input is the canonical version of the generalised quadrangle;
it suffices that the input has the correct polarity type.

<Oper Name="ProjectiveCompletion" Arg="as"/>
<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>as</A> is an affine space. This operation returns an embedding
of <A>as</A> into the projective space <A>ps</A> of the same dimension, and over the same field.
For example, the point <M>(x, y, z)</M> goes to the projective point with
homogeneous coordinates <M>(1, x, y, z)</M>. An intertwiner is unnecessary, 
<F>CollineationGroup(as)</F> is a subgroup of <F>CollineationGroup(ps)</F>.

<Returns>a geometry morphism</Returns>
<Description>
If one argument <A>vars</A> is given, then <A>vars</A> is the set of
k-subspaces of a projective space. If two arguments are given, then
<A>k</A> is a dimension and <A>ps</A> is a projective space. Finally,
if three arguments <A>k</A>, <A>n</A>, and <A>q</A> are given, then they
represent k-subspaces of the projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M>. Here,
k must be at least 1 but at most n-2. This operation returns a projective
algebraic variety; the Grassmann variety
<M>Gr(k,n,q)</M>.
