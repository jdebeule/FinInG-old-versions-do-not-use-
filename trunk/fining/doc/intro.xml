<Package>FinInG</Package> is a package for computation in 
finite geometry. It provides users with the basic tools to 
work in various areas of finite geometry from the realms of 
projective spaces to the flat lands of generalised polygons. 
The algebraic power of GAP is employed, particularly in its 
facility with matrix and permutation groups.

<Heading>Overview over this manual</Heading>

Chapter <Ref Chap="install"/> describes the installation of this package. Chapter <Ref
Chap="examples"/> contains some extended examples, ot introduce the user a bit to the basic
philosophy. Chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/> contains a rigourous discription of basic
structures. This chapter can be omitted at first reading, since the consequent chapters are also
self contained. Chapters <Ref Chap="projective_spaces"/>, <Ref Chap="projgroup"/> and <Ref Chap="polaritiesofps"/>
deal with projective spaces, projective semilinear groups, and polarities of projective spaces respectively.
Chapter <Ref Chap="classicalpolarspaces"/> deals extensively with classical polar spaces. Chapter <Ref Chap="affine"/>
deails with affine spaces and their groups. <E>Geometry morhpisms</E> between various geometries that are 
treated in the first nine chapters, are introduced and discussed in Chapter <Ref Chap="morphisms"/>. The final three
chapters, <Ref Chap="varieties"/>, <Ref Chap="gpolygons"/>, and <Ref Chap="diagramgeometries"/> deals with
algebraic varieties, which are constructed inside projective or affine spaces, generalised polygons, of which several
models can be constructed in <Package>FinInG</Package>, and finally coset geometries and diagrams, respectively.
