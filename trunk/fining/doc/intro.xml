This chapter gives a short introduction and explains the philosophy

<Package>FinInG</Package> (pronounciation: <Alt Only="LaTeX">\textipa{f\;I{}n\;I{}N}</Alt><Alt Only="HTML">f&#618;n&#618;&#331;</Alt>) is a package for computation in
Finite Incidence Geometry. It provides users with the basic tools to
work in various areas of finite geometry from the realms of
projective spaces to the flat lands of generalised polygons. 
The algebraic power of GAP is employed, particularly in its 
facility with matrix and permutation groups.

<Heading>Overview of this manual</Heading>

Chapter <Ref Chap="install"/> describes the installation of the package. Chapter <Ref
Chap="examples"/> contains some extended examples to introduce the user to the basic functionality and philosophy to get started. Chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/> contains a rigorous discription of the basic structures. This chapter can be omitted at first reading, since the set of consequent chapters is also self contained. Chapters <Ref Chap="projective_spaces"/>, <Ref Chap="projgroup"/> and <Ref Chap="polaritiesofps"/>
deal with projective spaces, projective semilinear groups and polarities of projective spaces, respectively.
In Chapter <Ref Chap="classicalpolarspaces"/> the functionality for classical polar spaces is treated and in Chapter <Ref Chap="affine"/> affine spaces and their groups are considered. <E>Geometry morphisms</E> between various geometries that are 
available in the package, are introduced and discussed in Chapter <Ref Chap="morphisms"/>. The final three chapters, <Ref Chap="varieties"/>, <Ref Chap="gpolygons"/>, and <Ref Chap="diagramgeometries"/> explain the basic functionality which is provided for algebraic varieties (in projective or affine spaces), generalised polygons, of which several models can be constructed, and finally coset geometries and diagrams.
