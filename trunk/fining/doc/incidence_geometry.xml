<Chapter Label="incidencegeometry">
<Heading>Incidence Geometry</Heading>

The term geometry, or incidence geometry, is interpreted broadly in this package.
The basis for the construction of the objects in this package is an abstract
incidence geometry consisting of elements, types, and an incidence relation. 
To be more specific, an <E>incidence geometry</E> consists of a set of elements
a symmetric relation on the elements and a type function from the set of
elements to an index set (i.e., every element has a ``type''). There are two axioms: 
(i) no two elements of the same type are incident; (ii) every maximal flag contains
an element of each type. Thus, a projective 5-space is an incidence geometry
with five types of elements; points, lines, planes, solids, and hyperplanes.<P/>

<Package>FinInG</Package> concerns itself primarily with the most
commonly studied incidence geometries of rank more than 2: projective spaces,
polar spaces, and affine spaces. However, some facility with generalised polygons
has been included. Throughout, no matter the geometry, we have made the convention that
an element of type 1 is a ``point'', an element of type 2 is a ``line'', and so forth.
The examples we use in this section use projective spaces, which have not introduced the 
reader to yet in this manual. For further information on projective spaces,
see Chapter <Ref Chap="projectivepolar"/>.

<Section>
<Heading>Basic operations on incidence geometries</Heading>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ElementsOfIncidenceStructure" Arg="ps, j"/>
<Returns>a list of elements</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. <A>j</A> must be
a type of element of <A>ps</A>. This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of type <A>j</A>. In an alternative form of this function
<A>j</A> can be one of ``points", ``lines", ``planes" or ``solids" and the
function returns the elements of type 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_elementsj.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Points" Arg="ps"/>
<Returns>a list of elements of type 1</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. 
This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of type 1.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_points.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Lines" Arg="ps"/>
<Returns>a list of elements of type 2</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. 
This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of type 2.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_lines.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Planes" Arg="ps"/>
<Returns>a list of elements of type 3</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. 
This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of type 3.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_planes.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Solids" Arg="ps"/>
<Returns>a list of elements of type 4</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. 
This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of type 4.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_solids.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="Hyperplanes" Arg="ps"/>
<Returns>a list of elements of maximal type</Returns>
<Description><A>ps</A> must be an incidence geometry. 
This function returns a list of all elements
of <A>ps</A> of the maximum type. This operation is
perhaps more synonomous and better suited when using projective
and affine spaces, however one can also use it for
an arbitrary incidence geometry.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_hyperplanes.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="IsIncident" Arg="u,v"/>
<Oper Name="\in" Arg="u,v"/>
<Returns>Boolean</Returns>
<Description>
<A>u</A> and <A>v</A> must be elements of an incidence geometry.
This function returns True if <A>u</A> and <A>v</A> are incident
and False otherwise. We have installed an overload of the operation
<C>in</C> which the user should think of as ``incident'' rather
than set theoretic inclusion. You can use these operations symmstrically,
that is <C>x in y</C> will return the same boolean value as <C>y in x</C>.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_isincident.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ShadowOfElement" Arg="geom, v, j"/>
<Returns> a collection of elements </Returns>
<Description>
<A>geom</A> is an incidence geometry. <A>v</A> must be an element of <A>geom</A>. This function returns a list of all elements of 
<A>geom</A> of type <A>j</A> which are incident with <A>v</A>.
This operation may not be installed for all incidence geometries.
In some case, such as when we are working with objects of
projective or polar spaces, we can just type <C>Points(v)</C> for the
set of points of the ambient geometry incident with <A>v</A>. We
can perform a similar operation with <C>Lines</C>, <C>Planes</C> and
<C>Solids</C>.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "../examples/include/incgeom_shadowofelement.include"> 
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ShadowOfFlag" Arg="geom, v, j"/>
<Returns> a collection of elements </Returns>
<Description>
<A>geom</A> must be aan incidence geometry. <A>v</A> must be a
list of elements of <A>geom</A>.
This function returns
a list of all elements of <A>geom</A> of type <A>j</A> which are incident
with every element of the list. The function assumes that the list <A>v</A>
is a flag; that is, every element of <A>v</A> is incident with every other
element of <A>v</A>. If <A>v</A> is not a flag then the return value
is unspecified. This operation may not be installed for all incidence geometries.
