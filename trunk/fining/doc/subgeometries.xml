<Heading>Subgeometries of projective spaces</Heading>

Let <M>S=(P,L,I)</M> be a point-line incidence geometry. In case <M>S</M> is a projective
space over a finite field, it is clear that every line (and every subspace as well) can
be identified with the set of points incident with it. Furthermore, the incidence
relation <M>I</M> is then symmetrised containment. To define a subgeometry
mathematically, we follow <Cite Key="Dembowski68"/>. Let <M>P' \subset P</M> and let
<M>L'</M> be a set of subsets of <M>P'</M>, such that every line <M>l' \in L'</M>
is a subset of exactly one line <M>l \in L</M>. If <M>S'=(P',L',I)</M> is a projective space
again, then we call <M>S'</M> a <E>subgeometry</E> of <M>S</M>. A typical example of a subgeometry
is a Baer subplane of a projective plane. Mathematically, any subspace of a projective 
space also induces a subgeometry. Using geometry morphisms, and more particular a 
function like <F>NaturalEmbeddingBySubField</F>, one can deal in an indirect way with subgeometries. 
However, using <F>NaturalEmbeddingBySubField</F> is not flexible, and typical problems such as 
considering a subgeometry determined by a user chosen frame and a subfield, cannot be handled
easily using <F>NaturalEmbeddingBySubField</F>. Therefore <Package>FinInG</Package> provides
some functions to naturally construct subgeometries of projective spaces.
<P/>
A subgeometry in a projective space is completely determined by a frame of the projective space
and a subfield of the base field of the projective space. The <E>standard frame</E> in an
<M>n</M>-dimensional projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M> is the set of <M>n+2</M> points represented by
<M>(1,0,\ldots,0),(0,1,\ldots,0),\ldots,(0,0,\ldots,1),(1,1,\ldots,1)</M>. The subgeometry
determined by the standard frame will be called <E>canonical</E>. Note that different
frames may determine the same subgeometry (over a fixed subfield). A subgeometry that
equals the subgeometry determined by the standard frame, will also be canonical

For a given subfield <M>GF(q') \subset GF(q)</M>,
the canonical subgeometry determined by the standard frame in <M>PG(n,q)</M> is mathematically spoken
the image of the <Package>FinInG</Package> geometry morphism <F>NaturalEmbeddingBySubField</F> of the
projective space <M>PG(n,q')</M>. The coordinates of the points of the subgeometry will be exclusively
over the subfield <M>GF(q')</M>, as are the coordinates of the vectors after normalizing defining
any subspace of the subgeometry. Clearly, the Frobenius automorphism <M>x->x^q'</M> fixes all elements
of the subgeometry.
<P/>
For an arbitrary frame of <M>PG(n,q)</M> and a subfield <M>GF(q')</M>, there exists a unique collineation
of <M>PG(n,q)</M> fixing the subgeometry <M>PG(n,q')</M> pointwise. This collineation is the conjugation
of the Frobenius automorhpism by the unique collineation mapping the defining frame of the subgeometry
to the standard frame of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. Upon construction of a subgeometry, both collineations will
be computed, and are of use when dealing with the full collineation group of a subgeometry. As for
any incidence geometry in <Package>FinInG</Package>, operations to compute that collineation group
and particular action functions for subgeometries are provided.

<Filt Name="IsSubgeometryOfProjectiveSpace" Type="Category"/>
<Description>
This category is a subcategory of <C>IsProjectiveSpace</C>, and contains all subgeometries of 
projective spaces. Note that mathmetically spoken, a subspace of a projective space is also a subgeometry.
However, in <Package>FinInG</Package>, subspaces of a projective space are constructed in a category that
is not a subcategory of <C>IsProjectiveSpace</C>. Since <C>IsSubgeometryOfProjectiveSpace</C> is a subcategory
of <C>IsProjectiveSpace</C>, all operations applicable on projective spaces, are naturally applicable on
subgeometries of projective spaces.

<Oper Name="CanonicalSubgeometryOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="pg, subfield"/>
<Oper Name="CanonicalSubgeometryOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="pg, q"/>
<Returns>A subgeometry of <A>pg</A></Returns>
<Description>This operation returns the subgeometry of <A>pg</A> induced by the standard frame
over the subfield <A>subfield</A>. Alternatively, the integer <A>q</A> can be used as the order of the
subfield. It is checked whether the user specified subfield is indeed a subfield of the base field of
<A>pg</A>. If the subfield equals the base field of <A>pg</A>, the projective space <A>pg</A> is returned.

<Oper Name="RandomFrameOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="pg"/>
<Returns>A set of points of <A>pg</A>, being a frame. Note that the returned object is also a
set in the GAP sense, i.e. an ordered list without duplicates.</Returns>

<Oper Name="IsFrameOfProjectiveSpace" Arg="list"/>
<Returns>true or false</Returns>
<Description>
When <A>list</A> is a list of points of a projective space, this operation returns true if and only
if <A>list</A> constitutes a frame of the projective space. It is checked as well whether all points
in <A>list</A> belong to the same projective space.

<Oper Name="SubgeometryOfProjectiveSpaceByFrame" Arg="pg, list, field"/>
<Oper Name="SubgeometryOfProjectiveSpaceByFrame" Arg="pg, list, q"/>
<Returns>A subgeometry of <A>pg</A></Returns>
<Description>
The argument <A>pg</A> is a projective space which is not a subgeometry itself, the argument
<A>list</A> is a list of points of <A>pg</A> defining a frame of <A>pg</A>, and finally the
argument <A>field</A> is a subfield of the base field of <A>pg</A>. Alternatively, the
argument <A>q</A> is an integer being the order of a subfield of the base field of <A>pg</A>.
This method returns the subgeometry definied by the frame in <A>list</A> and the subfield <A>field</A>
of the subfield <M>GF(<A>q</A>)</M>. This method checks whether the subfield <A>field</A> or the <M>GF(<A>q</A>)</M>
is really a sub field of the base field of <A>pg</A> and whether the list of points in <A>list</A> is a
frame of <A>pg</A>. Note also that it is currently not possible to construct subgeometries recursively,
so <A>pg</A> may not be a subgeometry itself. If the specified subfield equals the base field of
<A>pg</A>, then the projective space <A>pg</A> itself is returned.

<Heading>Basic operations</Heading>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="AmbientSpace" Arg="sub"/>
<Returns>A projective space</Returns>
<Description>
The ambient space of a subgeometry <A>sub</A> is the projective space of which <A>sub</A> is a subgeometry. This operation
returns the ambient space of the subgeometry <A>sub</A>. Different subgeometries can have the same ambient space.

<ManSection>
<Attr Name="DefiningFrameOfSubgeometry" Arg="sub"/>
<Returns>A set of projective points</Returns>
<Description>
This attribute returns a frame of the ambient space of <A>sub</A> defining it. Note that different frames
might define the same subgeometry, but the frame used to constructed <A>sub</A> is stored at construction,
and it is exactly this stored object that is returned by this attribute. The returned object is a set
of points, and it is also a set in the GAP sense, i.e. an ordered list withouth duplicates.

<Heading>Projective dimension and rank</Heading>
<Oper Name="ProjectiveDimension" Arg="sub"/>
<Oper Name="Dimension" Arg="sub"/>
<Oper Name="Rank" Arg="sub"/>
<Returns>an integer</Returns>
<Description>
If <A>sub</A> is a subgeometry of a projective space, then it is a projective space
itself. Therefore, these three operations return the projective dimension of <A>sub</A>,
see also <Ref Sect="proj:dimension"/>.

<Heading>Underlying algebraic structures</Heading>
<Oper Name="UnderlyingVectorSpace" Arg="sub"/>
<Oper Name="BaseField" Arg="sub"/>
<Oper Name="SubfieldOfSubgeometry" Arg="sub"/>
<Returns>A vector space, a finite field, a finite field respectively</Returns>
<Description>
The operations <F>UnderlyingVectorSpace</F> and <F>BaseField</F> are defined for
projective spaces, see <Ref Sect="proj:underlyingvs"/> and <Ref Sect="proj:basefield"/>.
For a subgeometry of a projective space <A>sub</A> with ambient space <A>ps</A>,
these operations return <F>UnderlyingVectorSpace(ps)</F>, <F>BaseField(ps)</F> respectively.
The operation <F>SubfieldOfSubgeometry</F> returns the subfield over which <A>sub</A> is defined.

<ManSection>
<Attr Name="CollineationFixingSubgeometry" Arg="sub"/>
<Returns>A collineation of the ambient space of <A>sub</A></Returns>
<Description>
Let <M>GF(q)</M> be the field over which <A>sub</A> is defined, this is a
subfield of <M>GF(q^t)</M> over which the ambient projective space <M>P</M>
is defined. It is well known that there exists a collineation of <M>P</M> of
order <M>t</M>, fixing all elements of <A>sub</A>, which is returned by this operation.
This collineation is the field automorphism of <M>GF(q^t)</M>, fixing all elements
of the subfield <M>GF(q)</M>, conjugated by the collineation of <M>P</M> mapping
the subgeometry <A>sub</A> on the canonical subgeometry of <M>P</M> over <M>GF(q)</M>
on the subgeometry <A>sub</A>. In case of a quadratic field extension (i.e. <M>t=2</M>),
this collineation is known in the literature as the Baer involution of the subgeometry.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="VectorSpaceToElement" Arg="sub, v"/>
<Returns>A subspace of a subgeometry</Returns>
<Description>
<A>sub</A> is a subgeometry of aprojective space, and <A>v</A> is either a row vector 
(for points) or an <M>m x n</M> matrix (for an (m-1)-dimensional subspace of a subgeometry of dimension <M>n-1</M> 
of aprojective space). In the case that <A>v</A> is a matrix, the rows represent generators 
for the subspace. An exceptional case is when v is a zero-vector, in which case the trivial 
subspace is returned. This method checks whether <A>v</A> determines an element of <A>sub</A>. The argument
<A>v</A> will typically be defined over the base field of <A>sub</A>, which is the base field of the ambient
space of <A>sub</A>.
