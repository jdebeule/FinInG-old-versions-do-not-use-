How to install orb, cvec and io under gap on a powerpc MacOSX platform?

1. Make sure you have an installed version of gap. We assume this is installed
in the directory '/opt/gap4r4/'. We assume that the 'gap.sh' file is copied into
a central exec directory, e.g. '/usr/bin/'. So we start GAP by issuing 'gap4r4'.

2. Localise the bin directory of the existing gap installation, this is e.g.
'/opt/gap4r4/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0-gcc/'

3. GAP packages can be installed in the central gap/pkg directorty or under a
local pkg directory of a user. We assume here the latter. In this example we
install packages in '/Users/jdebeule/pkg/'

4. Dowload and unpack the 'orb' package. Test the installation.

5. Dowload and unpack the 'io' package.

6. Dowload and upack the 'cvec' package.

7. We will have to compile io and cvec statically in the GAP kernel. Therefore,
go to the '/opt/gap4r4/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0-gcc/' directory, and issue
the following command:

' ./gac -o gap-static -p "-DIOSTATIC 
-I/opt/gap4r4/pkg/io/bin/i686-apple-darwin10.8.0-gcc -DGAUSSSTATIC" 
/opt/gap4r4/pkg/io/src/io.c  /Users/jdebeule/pkg/Gauss/src/gauss.c '

'./gac -o gap-static -p "-DIOSTATIC -DCVECSTATIC" 
/Users/jdebeule/pkg/io/src/io.c /Users/jdebeule/pkg/cvec/src/cvec.c'

This command compiles 'io.c' and 'cvec.c', and links afterwards all '.o' files,
including the 'io.o' and 'cvec.o' to the GAP kernel. 

8. If the above command is succesful, there must a an executable called
'gap-static' in the directory '/opt/gap4r4/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0-gcc/'. 

9. Go into the '/opt/gap4r4/bin' directory and copy the file 'gap.sh' into a
central directory like '/usr/bin' (where the other GAP startup script is
located). If you want, give it an appropriate name, e.g. 'gap4r4static'.

10. Open the file '/usr/bin/gap4r4static' and edit nearly at the end of the
file, edit  

if [ "x$GAP_PRG" = "x" ];  then
GAP_PRG=powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0-gcc/gap
fi

into 

if [ "x$GAP_PRG" = "x" ];  then
GAP_PRG=powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0-gcc/gap-static
fi

11. Issuing the command 'gap4r4static' with your usual options, should startup
GAP, with 'IO' loaded.

12. 'LoadPackage("cvec"); should load now the orb package and the cvec package.
