ADDED September 2008
====================

+- PG(3,2) should work, as well as ProjectiveGeometry

+- DesarguesianSpread

- There should be something for history (automatic "log" file for the input?)

+- Method for Random elements of e.g. Lines(pg). Add this to projectivespace.gi
  
- polarspace.gi and projectivespace.gi
	"size" should be removed in the "rec" field
	
- ConvertToMatrixRepNC: de NC zorgt ervoor dat er bij deze representatie niet meer
 gecontroleerd wordt
of het hier wel degelijk over een representatie gaat. 

OPGELET: ConvertToMatrixRepNC geeft niet de matrix terug, maar geeft de orde van
 het veld van de matrix
indien die bestaat); de output is dus geen matrix!!!!

line 48 moet dus "m" zijn ipv m2 #DIT IS NU REEDS VERANDERD (op de trein naar Edinburgh)

Opgelet met het veld hier! Zou een deelveld kunnen zijn! 

Dit zouden we moeten veranderen. De gebruiker zou hier ook een veld moeten opgev
en. 
Om later geen misverstanden te krijgen.

- About the setwise-stabiliser problem, it seems we should talk to Steve or use the orb package or use the partition backtrack for permutation groups.

-Gapdoc crash course.

-NiceMonomorophisms (inheritance)

-Filters overview (see ~/Gap/howto)

+-Stabilizer of a points in PG(3,8)
gap> hq:=HyperbolicQuadric(3,8);
Q+(3, 8)
gap> g:=CollineationGroup(hq);
PGammaO+(4,8)
gap> pg:=ProjectiveSpace(3,8);
PG(3, 8)
gap> x:=Random(Points(pg));
<a point in PG(3, 8)>
gap> Stabilizer(g,x,OnPoints);

-AlgebraicVarieties: currently only works for one defining polynomial. Should work for a list of polynomials.

-ProjectivePlane (should work for a set of points and a set of lines, blockmatrix, incidencematrix etc ...)

-VeroneseVarieties en alle ander varieties: 

-IsVarietyOfProjectiveAlgebraicVariety moet herdacht en opnieuw geimplementeerd worden

-RepresentativesVarietyTypes does not work for a projective space (it does work for symplectic space)

-What about the numer of entries in the record of e.g. ProjectiveSpace

-VectorSpaceToElement should be a method for each of the subcategories of IsLieGeometry

-For reasons of consistency make sure that the representation of IsElementsOf... belongs to IsComponentObjRep (consistent with vector spaces in gap).

-What about using mutable attributes? This would be handy for projective varieties and its points.

-Add a method for Dimension of projective space

-Hash function for OnProjectiveSubspacesAction


ADDED 27/12/2007
================

1. Documenting each single function/operation/method, etc....
2. Is everything running optimally? Test out various operations using good examples.
3. Subgeometry issues;
	3.1: we need a function which checks when something is a 
	subgeometry
	3.2: a function which generates the subgeometry, when given a 
	frame and a prime power.
	3.3: a function which generates a "canonical" subgeometry
4. Spreads, translation planes, etc... (separate package?) 
(interface with grape? design?)
	4.1 Spread sets, Andre-Bruck-Bose, ...
	4.2 PTR's
	4.3 Quasifields, semifields, loops (Gabor Nagy is working on loops and is interested).
5. Website for Desargues.																JAN
6. Polarities and correlations; associate the forms with polarities						JAN
7. Algebraic varieties (in general... we still need to think about how 
and what we want to do this). This is quite a tricky subject, what do we 
want, and what is possible, not too far fetched...
8. We want to adjust the field reduction which is already there for projective spaces so
that it works also for polar spaces.
9. Work on the user interface 
	9.1: all record and component access should have an associated operation
	9.2: think of nifty ways to make it easy to use (such as overloading "Points"
 	for ResidualOfVariety(pg, x, 1);
	9.3: try and make every example as stream-lined as possible
	9.4: avoid any ambiguous or easy-to-forget terminology (e.g., OnLieVarieties maybe
	such an example)
10. Diagram Geometries.
	10.1: implement a good, but not perfect, algorithm for deciding whether a group
	element is in a product AB of two subgroups (need this for coset geometries);
	10.2: heaps of operations/attributes need to be installed
11. Working with the projective groups. Point stabilisers, pointwise,					JAN
setwise stabilisers are too slow ...
	11.1: having stabiliser chains for projective groups will make everything so much better
	11.2: interface with "orb" and "genss"
12. Convert, where possible, matrices to 8-bit representation
13. testing, testing, and more testing!

ADDED 15/11/2007
================

Here is what needs to be done:

- debug \< for proj elements (with frob)
- TEST files !
- polarities as correlations (Jan will do this)
- generalised polygons (John will do this)
- documentation

- unique conic on five points
- unique baer subline on 3 points

- work on IsomorphismPolarSpaces (doesn't seem to be clean enough)
